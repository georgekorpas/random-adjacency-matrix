# random-adjacency-matrix

Python code to generate random adjacency matrices for undirected graphs with a specified number of vertices and components. It includes (a badly designed) functionality to validate whether a given matrix satisfies the criteria for an adjacency matrix of an undirected graph.

Features:

- Generate random adjacency matrices for undirected graphs with a specified number of vertices (n) and components (m).
- Validate generated adjacency matrices to ensure they meet the criteria for undirected graphs (square, symmetric, zeros on the diagonal).
